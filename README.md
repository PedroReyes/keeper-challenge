# Keeper of the Seven Keys - Java coding challenge

* Your full name: Pedro Jes√∫s Reyes Santiago
* Your email address: eagles.azul@hotmail.com
* Basic description of your solution: two algorithms has been implemented. The first algorithm is for the exploratory purpose, this algorithm will store in a stack the current path we are working on while at the same time stores in a list the nodes visited. Therefore, whenever we go back in stack we can know which are the alternatives paths from each node that were visited yet. The second algorithm is the well-known A* pathfinding algorithm, this algorithm is used to speed up the arrival to the door in case we know the position of this cell due to the exploratory period that we carried out at first.

Finally, send an Email to [sevenkeys@theworkshop.com](mailto://sevenkeys@theworkshop.com) with:
* GitHub link where we can download the solution, or URL to other file hosting system.
* Full name
* Phone number
* Copy of National ID card or passport photo page
