# Keeper of the Seven Keys - Java coding challenge

* Your full name: Pedro Jes√∫s Reyes Santiago

* Basic description of your solution: two algorithms has been implemented. The first algorithm is for the exploratory purpose, this algorithm will store in a stack the current path we are working on while at the same time stores in a list the nodes visited. Therefore, whenever we go back in the stack we can know which are the alternatives paths from each node that were not  visited yet. The second algorithm is the well-known A* pathfinding algorithm, this algorithm is used to speed up the arrival to the door in case we know the position of this cell due to the exploratory period that we carried out at first.
